```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
```

```{r}
lobsters <- read_csv(here("data", "Lobster_Abundance_All_Years_20210412.csv"), 
                     na = c("-99999", "")) %>%
  clean_names() %>% 
  uncount(count)

# dplyr::uncount()
```

```{r}
# create a summary table that finds the total counts and mean carapace lengths of lobsters in the observed dataset by site and year

mean_lengths_site_year <- lobsters %>% 
  group_by(site, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_size = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), n=n())
# n=n(), used within summarize, gives the count 

# create a ggplot graph of the number of total lobsters observed (y-axis) by year in the study, grouped by site

ggplot(data = mean_lengths_site_year,
       aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = site))
```

## Find the proportion of legal lobsters at each site for 2020

```{r}
# create a subset that only contains lobster data from 2020
lobsters_2020 <- lobsters %>% 
  filter(year == 2020)

# find the counts of lobsters observed at each site that are above and below the legal limit
lobsters_legal <- lobsters_2020 %>% 
  mutate(legal = case_when(
    size_mm > 79.76 ~ "yes",
    TRUE ~ "no"
  ))

legal_counts <- lobsters_legal %>% 
  group_by(site, legal) %>% 
  summarize(n = n())

legal_counts_tidy <- legal_counts %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = legal, values_from = n)
```

```{r}
# create a stacked column graph that shows the proportion of legal and non-legal lobsters at each site 

ggplot(data = legal_counts,
       aes(x = site, y = n, color = legal)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill")
```

## filter() practice

```{r}
# create and store a subset that only contains lobsters from sites IVEE, CARP, and NAPL

lobsters_subset1 <- lobsters %>% 
  filter(site %in% c("IVEE", "CARP", "NAPL"))

# create a subset that only contains lobsters observed in August
lobsters_subset2 <- lobsters %>% 
  filter(month == 8)

# create a subset with lobsters at Arroyo Quemado (AQUE) or with a carapace length greater than 70 mm
lobsters_subset3 <- lobsters %>% 
  filter(site == "AQUE", size_mm > 70)

# create a subset that does NOT include observations from Naples Reef (NAPL)
lobsters_subset4 <- lobsters %>% 
  filter(site != "NAPL")
```

## group_by() %\>% summarize() practice 

```{r}
# find the mean and standard deviation of lobster carapace length, grouped by site
lobsters_subset5 <- lobsters %>% 
  group_by(site) %>% 
  summarize(mean_size = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_size = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

# find the maximum carapace length by site and month.
lobsters_subset6 <- lobsters %>% 
  group_by(site, month) %>% 
  summarize(max_length = )
```
